This example demonstrates a potential data corruption issue in COBOL when using the REDEFINES clause. The program defines a numeric field and a string field with different PICTURE clauses. When writing to the numeric field and displaying the redefined string field, it results in data truncation. The solution involves ensuring that the PICTURE clause and data types are consistent to avoid this issue.
